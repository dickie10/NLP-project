# Claim Verification and Evidence Extraction Using BERT

## Description

Welcome to the repository for Claim Verification and Evidence Extraction using BERT. This project aims to provide a robust system for verifying claims and extracting supporting evidence by leveraging advanced natural language processing techniques.

## Instructions

1. **Top Documents Retrieval**: To retrieve top documents, please navigate to the `Top_documents` directory and execute the `data_par2` script. Ensure that SQLite is installed on your system for proper functionality.

2. **Download Wikipedia Dump 2017**:
   - Download the Wikipedia dump from [this link](https://fever.ai/download/fever/wiki-pages.zip). This dataset provides essential background information and context for claim verification and evidence extraction.

3. **Download Noun Phrase Documents**:
   - Access the noun phrase documents from [this source](https://public.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/fever-2018-team-athene/document_retrieval_datasets.zip). These documents are crucial for identifying and extracting relevant entities and phrases associated with the claims.
   
## Running the Model

To run the sentence retrieval and claim verification, please execute the `Bert_model_asp_1.ipynb` notebook on a GPU for optimal performance.
